# StoreSearch-UIKit

StoreSearch-UIKit is an iOS application built using **UIKit** that allows users to search for media items (such as apps, music, movies, and books) from the **iTunes Store API**. The project demonstrates **networking, JSON parsing, UI design with UIKit, and handling user input effectively**.

## Features

- **Search for media items** (Apps, Music, Movies, Books, etc.).
- **Display search results** in a clean, user-friendly UI.
- **Detailed view for selected items**, showing additional information.
- **Networking with URLSession** to fetch data from the iTunes API.
- **Custom table view cells** for an optimized search experience.
- **Adaptive UI with Auto Layout**, supporting different screen sizes.

## How It Works

1. The user enters a search term in the search bar.
2. The app makes a request to the **iTunes Search API**.
3. The response is parsed into a model and displayed in a table view.
4. Users can tap on a search result to view more details.

## Credits & Inspiration

This project was inspired by the "MyLocations" tutorial from the **UIKit Apprentice** book by **Kodeco**. Special thanks to the authors for their comprehensive guide on building iOS applications with UIKit.
